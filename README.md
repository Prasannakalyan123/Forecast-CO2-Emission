Collecting past years data of CO2 Emission from 1800-2014.
Appling EDA and Feature Engineering, Eliminating unwanted data.
Checking Stationary of the data using Dickey-Fuller test using adf.
Applying transformation functions to the data.
Finally Built ARIMA Model with the p, d and q values of (3,1,4).
We got good Accuracy with least rmse value of 0.848328 and mape value of 0.044454.
Deployment is done using Streamlit application and Predicting CO2 Emission using same model and Forecasting for next few year.
